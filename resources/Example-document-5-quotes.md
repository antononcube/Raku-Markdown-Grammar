Why ask for EBNF graphs with sentence collections, if we can just say:

> Give me a random EBNF grammar. (Or five.) 
 
**Remark:** Note, the implications of testing the parsers in that way. We can try to produce extensive parser tests
by multiple randomly obtained grammars from different LLMs. (Using different LLM parameters, like, temperatures, etc.)
